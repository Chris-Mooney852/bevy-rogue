# Bevy Rogue
This is simply a project for me to learn rust, while creating a roguelike in the bevy engine.

This project follows the amazing tutorial written by Herbert Wolverson [Roguelike Tutorial - In Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_0.html), with an attempt to switch out [bracket-lib](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib) with [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Useage

``` bash
cargo run
```

## Contributing
I'm still very new to rust, so if you see anything dumb, please feel free to educate me.
